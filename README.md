# ADAS_Project-Auto-steering-ACC-
This is the final project of EECS 461 in University of Michigan. The goal of the project is to simulate Auto steering and Adaptive Cruise Control.

ACC and self-steering are more and more used in automotive industry. 
Like recently, Honda implements Honda Sensing in 2016 in its new civic and accord. 
In this project, we use embedded system to achieve the same functions for a virtual vehicle. 
We use Simulink to establish vehicle models, and generating C code for the embedded system. 
The car can be driven by human, or work in ACC mode to keep a speed or distance from the vehicle ahead. 
Also, the car can be self-steering to keep in the middle of the road.

There are six file you would have in this project

 DrivingSimVR: Folder that contains the Windows graphics program
 parameters.m: MATLAB script to set model parameters
 Final project TEMPLATE.slx: Template Simulink model for the Project
 controllers.slx: Contains a position and a speed controller
 rappid 564xl user copy required les.m: place in the same folder as the main project Simulink file.
 Demo.mp4: show the result of ACC and auto-steering
